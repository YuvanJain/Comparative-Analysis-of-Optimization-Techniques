# Comparative Analysis of Optimization Techniques for PCOS Prediction

## Project Overview
This project presents a comparative analysis of different feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques—**PCA**, **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**, **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**, and **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**—applied to the prediction of **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** using machine learning models.

The objective is to evaluate how various optimization techniques impact model performance, accuracy, and feature relevance in a healthcare prediction task.
